## Description

Every Chinese student is aware that they must diligently engage with certain courses to successfully navigate the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE). 

For Chinese universities, we learn Advanced Math, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics etc.

However, many of us question the practical necessity of these courses. Post-examination, it seems unlikely that we will ever employ this knowledge again.

This perception is not entirely accurate, yet it's undeniable that the practical applications of these subjects are not readily apparent to us.

This project will elucidate the applications of mathematical concepts, both familiar and potentially unfamiliar, encountered during our educational journey, within the field of Computer Science.
